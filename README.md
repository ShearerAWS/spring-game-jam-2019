# Just Start at the Beginning
 
Unity project for the OSU Game Creation Club's 2019 Spring Game Jam
Created in 48 hours by Alexander Shearer

The theme for the game jam was "Frame". I chose to create a game that is told through a frame narrative, where the elements of the game would change through the narrative frame.
